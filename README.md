### A Discussion of Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features
- https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/
### Thought on paper
- The idea is Neural network catches human-insensitive features and uses it for classification
- The human-insentive featues are not "Robust", meaning that they are random and has weak correlation to result. Does it mean that dataset does not have enough data covers the distribution of this feature, like mentioned high frequency features in image? In other words, a man with a king-crown is classified as King, here king crown is not "Robust" feature.
